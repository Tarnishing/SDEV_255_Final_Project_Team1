Our client is the game studio, Zork Studios.

The system will be a text-based adventure game like Zork. The player can choose where to go and what to do using text. Usually the player will make those decisions based on the description given to them. For example, they enter a room where there is only one door, two windows, a bed, a nightstand, a candle holder with a lit candle in it, a chest, and a dresser. They might choose to think that it's just an ordinary room and turn back around to leave, or they might choose to investigate the chest. The point of the game is to be a mini getaway from reality. The endgame might be vanquishing a dragon, finding the key to the tower that a princess is locked away in... the possibilities are endless!
