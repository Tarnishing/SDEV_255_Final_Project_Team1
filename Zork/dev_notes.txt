main.py is the main function to run the game.

zork_functions.py stores all the individual functions for the game.

zork_objects.py stores all the objects for the game.

Chelsea notes: The way we can save the game is that every time the 
player clicks the "Save" button on the GUI, it will save what items
 they have, the room number they're in, and how far they've progressed
items will need to be programmed as a dictionary, room number assigned to 
the variable room_num for each tile of the map, and each decision they make will
 need to be assigned a value to the progress variable

[Chelsea reply: Hi Joe, the game progress is already recorded in the progress variable, so a different variable
                will need to be used to save the player's decisions.

                Save functionality won't be viable until your code is functional utilizing the logic in main.py
                that I fleshed out to connect your original coding to the frontend.
                
                I am working on trying to translate the code that's been added since the inital commit and push
                to try and help you, but it's inefficient to have to keep translating with each push. It would
                be much easier and more productive to make any additional coding work with the main.py file.
                Please work on that and then we can get to working on the save function. Thanks!]
