1. First, make sure that the indentation in game.html matches the indentation in write-to-html.py.
   The code that's between py-script tags won't work if the indentation is off.

2. In the terminal type the following:

        python -m http.server

    This will create a webserver on default port 8000. 
    If you want the port to be something else, type this then:

        python -m http.server 3000

    or whatever port number you want.

3. Navigate to localhost:8000/game.html
  (or whatever port number you chose instead of 8000)
