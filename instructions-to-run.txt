1. First, make sure that the indentation in game.html matches the indentation in write-to-html.py.
   The code that's between py-script tags won't work if the indentation is off.

2. Please do not use Live Server because the game will not function the way it should.

3. In the terminal type the following:

        python -m http.server

    This will create a webserver on default port 8000. 
    If you want the port to be something else, type this then:

        python -m http.server 3000

    or whatever port number you want.

4. Navigate to localhost:8000/game.html
  (or whatever port number you chose instead of 8000)
