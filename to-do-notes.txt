I need to figure out how to get create_proxy() to work so that DOM events can use Python functions as callbacks.
(Maybe a good solution? https://blog.logrocket.com/pyscript-run-python-browser/#using-pyscript-repl)

player_input.py --> put that code into write-to-html.py because it doesn't like circular references (main.py was
pointing to player_input.py and player_input.py was pointing to main.py)
    I think I figured out how to assign user input to a variable that can be used (in a VERY basic way... it will
    need to be more complex to handle all the different input prompts). When I check the Network responses it
    returns as a 200 status, so I think it works! But I feel like I won't know for sure until I can get
    create_proxy() working.
        + Testing using cases for it to work for more input prompts
